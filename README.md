# dNote 

The goal of this project was to give myself a quicker way to take notes when reading online pdfs.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo into your Python3 environment. I am still working on the proper way to format the batch file to work after cloning.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following modules:

```
os
```
## Usage

dNote '' : open cmd line for input
Following the prompt, you can either select a file you have already used, or create a new file.
The program will then prompt you for the new note to add and append it to the text file for later review.
